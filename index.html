  <h1>Stenographic System for Fast Programming</h1>
  <p>I want to create a stenographic system for programming faster. Ideally this system would not only be useful in
    programming contexts but would also be useful in any context where <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype">Stenotype</a> might be useful. I want to develop the hardware for
    this system using a <strong>pi pico</strong> and <strong>cherry-mx keyboard switches</strong>. The inputs would be
    mounted on an ergonomically 3d printed structure that will allow it to lay flat on desk while also providing full
    range of motion for wrist and finger joint articulation.</p>
